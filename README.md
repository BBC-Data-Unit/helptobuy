## Get the data

Data was taken from the property website Zoopla at the start of June 2016. The [browse facility](http://www.zoopla.co.uk/house-prices/) offers a way to go into each area, then sub-area, and then town. Areas with fewer than 10 properties for sale were omitted, as were those where averages were skewed by one particularly highly priced property.
